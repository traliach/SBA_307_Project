## DevOps Journey – From Code to Cloud

## Project Overview

This repo contains a small static website that introduces the idea of “From Code to Cloud”:

- **Home page** that tells your story and highlights key DevOps skills.
- **Tools & Projects page** that lists your tooling ecosystem and example DevOps projects.
- **Contact & DevOps Readiness page** with two forms: a contact form and a self-assessment checklist.

The site is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Bootstrap 5.3 (via CDN)**, with a small amount of custom CSS for animations and styling tweaks.
